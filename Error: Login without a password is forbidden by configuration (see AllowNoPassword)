Enabling the ability to manage MySQL via phpMyAdmin (when the root login is passwordless) is as easy as changing one line in a configuration file.

We’ll set the AllowNoPassword variable, located in phpMyAdmin’s configuration file, to TRUE. On an Ubuntu 15.04 server edit the following file:

vim /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

For a refresher on editing files with vim see: New User Tutorial: Overview of the Vim Text Editor

Find the line:

// $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = TRUE;

Uncomment that line; you’ll remove the //.

There are two instances of this line in the configuration file… be SURE to uncomment both of them!

Exit and save the file with the command :wq.
